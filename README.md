[Fuser Detector (Proof of Concept)]
Fuser Detector is a proof of concept tool designed to demonstrate the detection of potentially emulated or suspicious monitors. 
The application uses registry entries and hardware monitor information to assess whether any active or registered displays on the system exhibit suspicious characteristics.

[Important Notes]
Proof of Concept Only
This project is a demonstration of detection capabilities and should not be used as a definitive or production-grade solution. The detection is heuristic-based and may result in false positives or negatives.
Its primary purpose is to show the feasibility of detecting suspicious monitors using Windows API and registry analysis.

[No Guarantee of Accuracy]
The "suspicious" criteria are simplistic and designed for educational purposes. The program does not perform sophisticated validation of monitor authenticity.

[Disclaimer]
This tool is not intended to detect malicious hardware or provide cybersecurity guarantees. It should be used purely for educational purposes to understand monitor detection techniques and limitations.
